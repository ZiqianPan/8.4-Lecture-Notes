# Class Components
  - In React we can create class components by extending the `React.Component` class
    - IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE MUST IMPORT REACT INTO OUR FILE!
  - Class components are more verbose than functional components but have the built-in advantage of being able to store and handle data and allowingus to give our class component additional methods to handle our logic.
  - Like our classes, class components must have a constructor and you must define the super method within the constructor 
  - Instead of returning our JSX we muct use `React.Component` class method `render()` in order to render our JSX.
